I am currently an Economics PhD student at the University of Bristol in England expecting to graduate in the coming months. 

My research interests are primarily in education, both K - 12 and higher education. My dissertation primarily focused on education in the US, where I examine the effects of local (sub-state) minimum wages on high school enrollment in California and the effect that homicides have on elementary school students in Chicago.
