I am currently an Economics PhD student at the University of Bristol in England expecting to graduate in the coming months. 

My research interests are primarily in education, both K - 12 and higher education. My dissertation mainly focused on education in the US. For example, in one chapter I examine the effects of local (sub-state) minimum wages on high school enrollment in California. In another chapter I look at the effect that local homicides have on elementary school attendance in Chicago. Outside of my research I enjoy reading new papers on causal inference.

I am also an avid baseball fan.
