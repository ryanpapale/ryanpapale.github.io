        <main>
            <p>
                I grew up in Oceanside, CA, and in 2025 I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Bristol. My research focused on applied labor economics, 
                particularly in education. <br><br>
                In my spare time I enjoy watching baseball and running regressions in R. <br><br>
                This website is where I will share my personal projects, mostly in baseball and economics, but possibly other things I find interesting as well. <br><br>
                You can find my baseball projects in the "Baseball" section. In the "Economics" section I have uploaded my PhD dissertation, separated by chapter. And my contact
                details are in the "Contact" section along with my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
