            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I grew up in Oceanside, CA, and in 2025 I received my PhD in Economics from the University of Bristol. My research focused on applied labor economics, 
                particularly in education. <br><br>
                In my spare time I enjoy watching baseball and running regressions in R. <br><br>
                This website is where I will share my personal projects, mostly in baseball and economics, but possibly other things I find interesting as well. <br><br>
                You can find my baseball projects in the Baseball section. In the Economics section I have uploaded some of my research. And my contact
                details are in the Contact section.
